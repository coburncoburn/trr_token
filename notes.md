Authentication Via Blockchain

* Track exactly what has happened to a product after its purchase
* The product history can be anything from how you actually took care of it, like how the maintenance was done, or who owned it. 
* The digital handshake will open up a chain of communication that couldn’t have happened before.
* Younger customers do much more research around each purchase, and that research should and will include the integrity and the ethics of each company they’re supporting.
* There is huge potential for luxury on the blockchain. When you’re spending thousands of dollars on a Birkin bag for examples, you want to know where each piece was made, what it’s made from, who designed it and when it was made. That really matters in a luxury purchase.
* Having a detailed ledger of an item’s history on the blockchain isn’t going to be the first factor that convinces a customer to make a purchase — that will always be price and style. But transparency could be the tiebreaker.
* Establish a proof of authenticity and a proof of ownership.



* It will make authenticating a product much easier and more certain.
* If someone else figures this out before us, they can run us out of business.

* Assuming every item can be authenticated on the blockchain using some kind of identifier (e.g: NFC chip):
If we are ahead of the curve and can support this method of authentication without items coming into our warehouse, we might still be competitive over ebay for example.
